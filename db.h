// how this works
//
// There are 64 squares on the board, so we keep a bitmap where
// each bit represents whether a piece is present or not. The
// index of the bit is the square number, and the cnt of the bit
// is the index into the lo/hi population to identify what the
// piece is.
//
// lo and hi are 64-bit values, mapped into 16 4-bit values that
// identify each piece. Since there can be no more than 32 pieces
// this sufficies for encoding any possible possition.
//
// This is the packed encoding for the initial position:
//
//   uint64_t pop = 0xffff00000000ffff;
//   uint64_t hi  = 0xdcb9abcdeeeeeeee;
//   uint64_t lo  = 0x6666666654312345;
//
// The square numbers (0-63) are represented by the pop value and
// are interpreted left-to-right, so the first bit represent square
// A1 on the board. Another point of confusion is that since there
// can be at most 32 pieces on the board, then there can only be 32
// bits set in this 64 bit map. Also, each piece is encoded as a
// 4-bit value, which is futher packed into two 64-bit values. So,
// as the pop map is traversed, a count of set bits (usually referred
// to as the population of bits) is made, with the ordinal of any
// given bit being the index into the hi/lo packed maps. So even though
// the pop map contains 64 bits, at most its population is 32 bits set.
//
// The lo and hi maps are treated as a single 128-bit value, and more
// specifically as an array of 32 4-bit values that identify each
// specific piece.
